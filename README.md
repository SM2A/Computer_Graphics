# Computer Graphics Course Project

This repository contains my Computer Graphics Course Project (Spring 2022) at University of Tehran.

#### Requirements

This project is build for windows and uses win32 api to work. I used freeglut library to make using **OpenGL** easier.

You can find out more about *freeglut* [here](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/).

Then you can download *freeglut* library from [here](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/).
Because we are working on windows you should download MinGW package.

First you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed on you system. Then install above mentioned library on your MinGW.

You can learn more about MinGW [here](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) and download [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

#### How to Run

After meeting the needs of requirements we are ready to build and run project
